The technology curve is accelerating at a exponential rate, and this is no more evident than in the field of AI and Computer Vision. Coupling cloud based compute with more capable IoT edge solutions, use cases once deemed difficult and costly are now being realized. Look no further than the ramp and our turn timeline.

Today, many of our events are digitized and fired on our event bus. OOOI (Out, Off, On, In) Times are the quintessential example of this. These events are sourced from the Aircraft and transferred via ACARS to our on-premises event bus (TIBCO), which our in turn "bridged" to the core Service Bus in our Azure Cloud, forming the backbone of our enterprise core bus.

But what about those "Analog" events, such as when the catering truck or belt-loader arrives at the aircraft. These are more difficult to capture. We do have some candidate options though:
