A little over a year ago (F), I was preparing to speak at the xx [2020 Innovation@Airports Conference](https://airportscouncil.org/conference/2020-innovation-at-airports/) as part of the Airports Council International conference series. Perhaps I'll share my session presentation at a future date, but today I want to reflect on a seemingly innocuous comment made during that session.

At a prep session on Friday, January 17th, one of the organizers had mentioned that she had just come from a meeting where there was talk of closing down all commercial air traffic between the US and China. She mentione the word Coronovirus and reflected that it appeared to be on the level of SARS or the Bird Flu. All air traffic from China was now going to be directed to [a few US Domestic airports](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/02/02/dhs-issues-supplemental-instructions-inbound-flights-individuals-who-have-been-china).

Little did I know, that one year later, we would see the loss of almost SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVES in the United States alone. I hesitate writing this post now, knowing that the Coronovirus (COVID-19) is continuing to ravage large swaths of the globe, having recent devastating effects in Argentina, Brazil and India. Yet, we tend to mark the passage of a year as time for reflection, and already the details of the past 16 months have begun to fade.

Locally in Seattle, the country's [first know case of Coronovirus](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/case-of-wuhan-coronavirus-detected-in-washington-state-first-in-united-states/) had occurred on January 19th. At work things were continuing "normally". I flew to San Francisco for conference session, flying down in the morning, and back to Seattle later that evening.

I had vacation scheduled to Columbus, OH in March to watch a friend compete in "The Arnold". 

At work, we launched into an aggressive marketing campaign to demonstrate the [real steps we were taking](http://web.archive.org/web/20200315035953/https://blog.alaskaair.com/coronavirus/) to keep a safe environment in-flight.
