With the release of Azure Percept Studio and the Azure Percept Device Kit (DK), Microsoft has made it easy to create and deploy AI models to edge devices. A demonstrator project can be up and running in minutes, but what if you want to build a more sustainable solution?

In this and future posts I'll share how I'm creating a more sustainable and maintainable environment for building and deploying IoT Edge based solutions using Azure Percept and its Device Kit. This post will cover creating an Azure environment for hosting these solutions in a repeatable way. Future posts will cover other aspects such as Device Updates, Continuous Integration and Deployment, Cost Optimization and potentially availability and continuity.

The Azure Percept DK has a fantastic Out of the Box Experience
I've been working with the Azure Percept Device Kit for the past year when it was known as [Project Santa Cruz](https://github.com/mikelor/azure-percept-private-preview). During that time, I've had to update the firmware on the device multiple times
