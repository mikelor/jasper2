# What did I just do?
According to [AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/learn/breakout-content/) website, there are 50 content tracks and more than **2,000 sessions!** The conference itself is spread over a ["campus"](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/campus/#map) of 6 resorts on opposite ends Las Vegas Strip. It's been five years since my last AWS re:Invent conference, and if there is only one takeaway, it's this: You Need a Plan.

# My Goal
It's been a couple of years since I worked with AWS. The pace of change happens at breakneck speed in the cloud, so it's likely that what I worked with 2 years ago, would be a faint afterimage of AWS today. 

## Prioritize Conference Tracks
The graphic below is my attempt to make some sense out of the myriad of sessions listed in the conference catalog. 
![Conference Tracks Grouped and Prioritized](assets/images/aws/prioritizationMap.png)

I've grouped them in three major areas
  1. Platform and Infrastructure Services
  1. Software Applications and Industry Solutions
  1. Management, Delivery, and Best Practices

My main focus would be on the next level of cloud architecture, staying away from the core Infrastructure pieces but instead prioritize serverless, platform, and analytics services.
