# The Map
Every roadtrip has a [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1UJwCHbAVw2wCqp3Wa9FL8uOAQUM0ZXk&usp=sharing). Follow along as I take you on an 1500 mile trip across the third coast.

# The Playlist
I created a [Spotify Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0VFFfKQn9SoJ6cykn9r27T?si=528f8dadf5824a5d) for this roadtrip. It's a mix of Bayou, Texas Coastal, and San Antonio / Austin country. Why not listen along as you read my trip report. <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/0VFFfKQn9SoJ6cykn9r27T?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

# Day 1 - Getting Started
Hopped an American Airlines flights\ from Las Vegas to New Orleans via Dallas-Fort Worth. I pickup my one-way rental at Avis, where they searched for the highest mileage car they had. This means I would be driving a nice Ford Explorer Limited with 29K miles instead of the mid-size car I reserved. I consider this an upgrade. üòÑ

## From MSY to Morgan City
I headed straight out of New Orleans via I-310 South, crossing the Mississippi and on to State Route 90. I try to avoid Interstates and main routes if I can help it, so when I got a chance to take the "Old Spanish Trail" near Paradis, I took it.

During my pre-roadtrip planning, I scouted a stop near Des Allemands, called Shell Mound Cemetary. ‚ÄúDes Allemandes‚Äù translates in French to mean ‚Äúthe Germans‚Äù, it was one of the original German settlements established in 1721. It turns out this area has a much richer history, being part of the ["Sims Site"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sims_site) archaelogical site. In a [report from Rob Mann](https://web.archive.org/web/20151023120545/http://www.laarchaeology.org/newsletters/2006%20No.%201.pdf) we learn the site originally consisted of at least five earthen mounds, only two mounds and possibly the remnants of a third mound are extant today. 

I never really located one of the mounds, but looking back at my pictures, there may be one in the back of the first photo below. ü§™

It turns out I got a couple of bonus shots from this stop. The first is of a moss encrusted tree overlooking a green pond. To get this shot, I crossed the railroad tracks and drove a short way down Shell Mound Road.

The second shot was of a broken cross grave marker in Shell Mound Cemetary.
