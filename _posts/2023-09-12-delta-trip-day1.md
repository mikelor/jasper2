Come along as we explore Southwest Tennessee, and then take a deep dive into the Mississippi Delta as we explore the early roots of the Delta Blues.

# Background
This roadtrip evolved a lot from when I first booked it back in April. My original plan was to drive from Nashville to Saint Louis via Tulsa continuing the Route 66 theme of my [first roadtrip](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/3/edit?mid=1-QQX66fc359wj0v4VkK4FKOk-fY4r5Y&usp=sharing) over a year ago. 

I had to rethink that plan once I realized the rental car company was going to charge me 30 cents a mile. I'm assuming this is because it was a one-way rental. 

Fortunately for me, I reached out to a few [Reddit](https://reddit.com) groups whose members, especially [r/mississippi](https://www.reddit.com/r/mississippi/comments/169auyj/nashville_mississippi_delta_natchez_trace/) made a compelling reason to take a trip through blues history in the Mississippi Delta. Maybe we will find some live music along the way too.

# The Map
Every roadtrip has a [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/3/edit?mid=1TOn-0MqT0Vx4tdH5zmcdEVTukpmtUlI&usp=sharing). Follow along as we explore the roots of the Delta Blues. This is my actual route as opposed to my [planned route]

# The Playlist
I created a [Spotify Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0VFFfKQn9SoJ6cykn9r27T?si=528f8dadf5824a5d) for this roadtrip. It's heavily focused on the early Delta Blues. Why not listen along as you read my trip report.

# Day 1 - Getting Started
I left Las Vegas late afternoon on [@alaskaair](https://twitter.com/alaskaair), and like most Alaska Airlines flights, I needed to get to Seattle before making a flight to Nashville on a Redeye.

My flight landed in Nashville around 5:30am and I headed to pickup the rental car. The App announced that I had received a Complimentary Upgrade...to a MiniVan. Rather than accept that, I headed to the space number to check it out. Umm, this would be a Hard No. The Preferred Window wasn't due to open for

# Morning Stops
Tripperist App in hand, it was time to hit my first of three stops.

## The Nashville Parthenon
The Parthenon in Centennial Park, Nashville, Tennessee, is a full-scale replica of the original Parthenon in Athens. It was built in 1897 as part of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition. It was too early to go inside, so I snapped this picture on my walk around the park. It felt good to stretch my legs after the flight from Seattle.

## The Tomb of President James Polk
The 11th President of the United States (1845-1849) Polk took up the cause of US Expansion in the 19th Century. President during the acquisition of the Oregon territory in 1846 and the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, under the guise of "Manifest Destiny". I'll talk more about Polk when I visit his home on the return portion of my trip.

## The Loveless Cafe
Scratch Southern Meals include Homeade Hot Biscuits. So many people come to taste the biscuits that put us on the map that theyâ€™re now making up to 10,000 every day. I stopped in for an amazing breakfast, and of course Biscuits and Preserves. This is definitely one stop you need to make if you are passing by.
