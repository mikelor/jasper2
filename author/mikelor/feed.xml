      <content type="html" xml:base="/delta-trip-day1">&lt;p&gt;Come along as we explore Southwest Tennessee, and then take a deep dive into the Mississippi Delta as we explore the early roots of the Delta Blues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cover art generated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/dall-e-2&quot;&gt;Dalle-2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This roadtrip evolved a lot from when I first booked it back in April. My original plan was to drive from Nashville to Saint Louis via Tulsa continuing the Route 66 theme of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/3/edit?mid=1-QQX66fc359wj0v4VkK4FKOk-fY4r5Y&amp;amp;usp=sharing&quot;&gt;first roadtrip&lt;/a&gt; over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to rethink that plan once I realized the rental car company was going to charge me 30 cents a mile. I’m assuming this is because it was a one-way rental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for me, I reached out to a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; groups whose members, especially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mississippi/comments/169auyj/nashville_mississippi_delta_natchez_trace/&quot;&gt;r/mississippi&lt;/a&gt; made a compelling reason to take a trip through blues history in the Mississippi Delta. Maybe we will find some live music along the way too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-map&quot;&gt;The Map&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every roadtrip has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/3/edit?mid=1TOn-0MqT0Vx4tdH5zmcdEVTukpmtUlI&amp;amp;usp=sharing&quot;&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;. Follow along as we explore the roots of the Delta Blues. This is my actual route as opposed to my [planned route]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1TOn-0MqT0Vx4tdH5zmcdEVTukpmtUlI&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ehbc=2E312F&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-playlist&quot;&gt;The Playlist&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0VFFfKQn9SoJ6cykn9r27T?si=528f8dadf5824a5d&quot;&gt;Spotify Playlist&lt;/a&gt; for this roadtrip. It’s heavily focused on the early Delta Blues. Why not listen along as you read my trip report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe style=&quot;border-radius:12px&quot; src=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/3p06d3gSQFDOyw4sLCCVdx?utm_source=generator&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;352&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;day-1---getting-started&quot;&gt;Day 1 - Getting Started&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left Las Vegas late afternoon on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alaskaair&quot;&gt;@alaskaair&lt;/a&gt;, and like most Alaska Airlines flights, I needed to get to Seattle before making a flight to Nashville on a Redeye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My flight landed in Nashville around 5:30am and I headed to pickup the rental car. The App announced that I had received a Complimentary Upgrade…to a MiniVan. Rather than accept that, I headed to the space number to check it out. Umm, this would be a Hard No. The Preferred Window wasn’t due to open for 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.09.BNABlues/Chrysler300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chrysler 300&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;morning-stops&quot;&gt;Morning Stops&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tripperist App in hand, it was time to hit my first of three stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-nashville-parthenon&quot;&gt;The Nashville Parthenon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parthenon in Centennial Park, Nashville, Tennessee, is a full-scale replica of the original Parthenon in Athens. It was built in 1897 as part of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition. It was too early to go inside, so I snapped this picture on my walk around the park. It felt good to stretch my legs after the flight from Seattle.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.09.BNABlues/Parthenon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Nashville Parthenon&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tomb-of-president-james-polk&quot;&gt;The Tomb of President James Polk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 11th President of the United States (1845-1849) Polk took up the cause of US Expansion in the 19th Century. President during the acquisition of the Oregon territory in 1846 and the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, under the guise of “Manifest Destiny”. I’ll talk more about Polk when I visit his home on the return portion of my trip.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.09.BNABlues/PolksTomb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;President Polk's Tomb&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-loveless-cafe&quot;&gt;The Loveless Cafe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scratch Southern Meals include Homeade Hot Biscuits. So many people come to taste the biscuits that put us on the map that they’re now making up to 10,000 every day. I stopped in for an amazing breakfast, and of course Biscuits and Preserves. This is definitely one stop you need to make if you are passing by.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.09.BNABlues/TheLovelessCafe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Loveless Cafe&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at this point started my journey down the Historic Natchez Trace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally a route forged by prehistoric animals, and later by Native Americans, then Europeans, the 444 mile Trace followed the geographic ridgeline from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the Natchez Trace Parkway parallels the historic Old Trace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you drive the Trace, make sure you respect the 50 MPH speed limit as the Federal Park Rangers patrol and enforce regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every now and then you can take a short drive on the “Old Trace” I don’t think I could do more than 20 MPH on this part even if I tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.09.BNABlues/DrivingTheTrace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A drive down the Old Trace.&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress made their first declaration of war in 1812 in response to Great Britain’s impedence of the new republic’s desire to expand their territorial holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Natchez Trace served as an important route to move troops for the defense of the region. Tennessee volunteers under the command of Andrew Jackson marched down the Natchez Trace to Natchez in January 1813.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the victory at the Battle of New Orleans, most of the Americans who fought the battle returned on the Trace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This memorial is dedicated to all those who perished along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.09.BNABlues/WarOf1812.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;War of 1812 Memorial.&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick rest stop at the Baker Bluff Overlook. In a generally flat area, this provided a small Overlook to the river valley below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.09.BNABlues/BakerBluffOverlook.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Baker Bluff Overlook.&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built in 1818, the Gordon House was one of the more impressive homes in the area. It was a landmark for travelers of the Old Trace, letting them know that soon they would be in Nashville.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also served as a place for a ferry crossing of the Duck river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.09.BNABlues/GordonHouse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The GordonHouse.&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of sites along the trace, so it’s a bit challenging for me to balance seeing them all and making time. The Fall Hollow Falls stop, was great to get out and stretch my legs, but I probably wouldn’t stop by again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.09.BNABlues/FallHollowFalls.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The GordonHouse.&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One stop that I would recommend was &lt;a href=&quot;https://perrycountylibrary.info/historical-society/pinckney-s-tomb&quot;&gt;Pinckney’s Tomb&lt;/a&gt;. Pinckney Hufstedler had an aversion to water getting into his grave.  Accordingly, he constructed a large wood and stone gravehouse over the graves of his immediate family.  It originated as a low limestone wall surrounding a handful of graves to which Hufstedler added the wooden walls and roof about 1885.  The uncommon structure is thought to be the largest gravehouse in Tennessee. Hufstedler also asked that his body be transported to the burial site in a wagon drawn by white oxen, rather than mules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.09.BNABlues/HufstedlerGraveHouse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pinckney's Tomb.&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s getting close to 1pm in the afternoon now, and my hunger is telling me it’s time to pull over, and finish off the other half of my Loveless Cafe breakfast. So I find a nice spot along the Tennessee River at Clifton City Park to relax and dig back into my pulled-pork omelette and biscuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.09.BNABlues/CliftonCityPark.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lunch along the Tennessee river.&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s on to Savannah, TN, where all spend the night in a lovely Days Inn. The next morning we’ll drive into Mississippi but not before visiting a Civil War battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;day-1---getting-started&quot;&gt;Day 1 - Getting Started&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopped an American Airlines flight from Las Vegas to New Orleans via Dallas-Fort Worth. I pickup my one-way rental at Avis, where they searched for the highest mileage car they had. This means I would be driving a nice Ford Explorer Limited with 29K miles instead of the mid-size car I reserved. I consider this an upgrade. 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/travelogue/2023.03.MSYAUS/CarRental.png&quot; alt=&quot;My rental car with 29,058 starting mileage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-msy-to-morgan-city&quot;&gt;From MSY to Morgan City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed straight out of New Orleans via I-310 South, crossing the Mississippi and on to State Route 90. I try to avoid Interstates and main routes if I can help it, so when I got a chance to take the “Old Spanish Trail” near Paradis, I took it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.03.MSYAUS/Day1Drive.png&quot; alt=&quot;Day 1 Drive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stop-1---des-allemands--shell-mound-cemetary&quot;&gt;Stop 1 - Des Allemands / Shell Mound Cemetary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my pre-roadtrip planning, I scouted a stop near Des Allemands, called Shell Mound Cemetary. “Des Allemandes” translates in French to mean “the Germans”, it was one of the original German settlements established in 1721. It turns out this area has a much richer history, being part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sims_site&quot;&gt;“Sims Site”&lt;/a&gt; archaelogical site. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20151023120545/http://www.laarchaeology.org/newsletters/2006%20No.%201.pdf&quot;&gt;report from Rob Mann&lt;/a&gt; we learn the site originally consisted of at least five earthen mounds, only two mounds and possibly the remnants of a third mound are extant today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never really located one of the mounds, but looking back at my pictures, there may be one in the back of the first photo below. 🤪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.03.MSYAUS/ShellMoundWide.png&quot; alt=&quot;Shell Mound Cemetary, Des Allemands. Potential Shell Mound far backk on the right.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out I got a couple of bonus shots from this stop. The first is of a moss encrusted tree overlooking a green pond. To get this shot, I crossed the railroad tracks and drove a short way down Shell Mound Road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.03.MSYAUS/ShellMoundTree.png&quot; alt=&quot;Shell Mound Road Tree.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the street from the cemetary, google maps highlights the “Photo Tree Des Allemands”. While it’s an interesting tree, I found the one above more photogenic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second shot was of a broken cross grave marker in Shell Mound Cemetary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.03.MSYAUS/ShellMoundCross.png&quot; alt=&quot;Shell Mound Cemetary, Des Allemands. Potential Shell Mound far backk on the right.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my playlist rollin’ and the scenery I was catchin’ I was soon in the Bayou Mood, so I wrote this…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Bayou Mood

Headin' down the Delta
Gonna see what I can find,
Headin' down the Delta
Gonna see what I can find,
Broken cross at the crossroads
Don't do much to ease my mind.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stop-2---bayou-lafourche&quot;&gt;Stop 2 - Bayou LaFourche&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was back on the highway towards Raceland, but instead of continuing East, I turned down LA1 which follows Bayou LaFourche. Before the highway, the river was the main thoroughfare through this area. Louisia Dread has a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6nksKjbNXH0ZFsZjeHebbSUH_LTyNC3h&quot;&gt;series of YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt; about all of the communities lining it’s path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my trip through Louisiana, I reached out to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisiana/comments/10vrg12/roadtrip_from_new_orleans_to_austin_along_the/&quot;&gt;r/Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; Reddit group for places to see. Two places along this route were suggested (see map at the beginning of this post for more detail.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately both places were not open the hours I drove by, so instead I decided to stop along the side of the Bayou to grab a couple of shots. Listening to the playlist, and driving through the small communities put my mind in a very laid back mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.03.MSYAUS/BayouLaFourcheBoat.png&quot; alt=&quot;Boat along the shore of Bayou LaFourche&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.03.MSYAUS/BayouLaFourcheBridge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bridge over Bayou LaFourche&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was getting to be late morning, and I still needed to make Morgan City in time for dinner, so I turned back North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stop-3---quick-bite-in-houma&quot;&gt;Stop 3 - Quick Bite in Houma&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drove through Houma, with a quick stop a the Fiery Crab Seafood Restaurant and Bar. The goal was to stop in for a quick bite and a cold beer. Little did I know that this type of restaurant specializes in Seafood Boils. I wasn’t &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; hungry, so I had some fried oysters and a Bud Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stop-4---ed-white-historic-site&quot;&gt;Stop 4 - E.D. White Historic Site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued my scenic drive along Bayou LaFourche. The drive being quite mellow and scenic, I arrived a bit late to this stop. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lacajunbayou.com/things-to-see-and-do/tours-and-attractions/ed-white-historic-site&quot;&gt;The historic site&lt;/a&gt; is the residence of two of Louisiana’s foremost political figures: Edward Douglas White, who was governor from 1835 to 1839, and his son, Edward Douglass White, who was appointed to the United States Supreme Court in 1894 and served as chief justice from 1910 to 1921.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.03.MSYAUS/EDWhiteHistoricSIte.png&quot; alt=&quot;E.D. White Historic Site&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.03.MSYAUS/WhitePineRoad.png&quot; alt=&quot;E.D. White Historic Site&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a good learning opportunity for me. I’m testing out my Roadtrip App on my drives, and one thing I need to pull into list is hours of operation, much like google maps does. Right now, the App will present you with a list of nearby historical markers and give you some information about them (more on this in a future post.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travelogue/2023.03.MSYAUS/AppScreenShot.png&quot; alt=&quot;App Screen Shot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stop-5---morgan-city&quot;&gt;Stop 5 - Morgan City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long day of driving, I was ready ready to check-in to my hotel for the night. When I landed at MSY, I booked my room at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotels-in-morgan-city/best-western-morgan-city-inn/propertyCode.19135.html&quot;&gt;Morgan City Best Western&lt;/a&gt;. Super nice people, with clean comfortable rooms. I’d stay here again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that’s Day 1. I guess I’ll make each Day their own post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title type="html">Three Years of TSA Throughput Data</title>
      <link href="/three-years-of-tsathroughput" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Three Years of TSA Throughput Data" />
      <published>2023-01-03T12:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2023-01-03T12:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/three-years-of-tsathroughput</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/three-years-of-tsathroughput">&lt;p&gt;These photos taken almost 2 years apart illustrate the drastic dropoff and dramatic comeback in air travel passenger volume. Yet even these pictures have difficulty in conveying just how fast and far those volumes dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tsa-throughput-project&quot;&gt;The TSA Throughput Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I know this? Well, it turns out that the TSA publishes the number of passengers screened at all domestic airports on a regular basis. They make this information available on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tsa.gov/foia/readingroom&quot;&gt;Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Reading Room website&lt;/a&gt;. During the pandemic, as a sort of deranged therapy, I started tracking the TSA Throughput on a regular basis. This took a bit of work as the TSA only publishes their data in PDF format (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both pictures are of the Alaska Airlines lobby in SEA. The left one is from my March 22, 2020 flight to LAS, I was just one of 7,642 SEA passengers screened by TSA that day (compared to 55,933 on March 22, 2019). The one on the right is from my Christmas day 2022 trip when 44,527 passengers were screened by TSA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEA would finally bottom out on April 8th, 2020 with just 2,564 passengers screened at all TSA checkpoints. Please note that this total does not include passengers who may be connecting in SEA as they usually do not need to go through TSA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll cover SEA and other airports in a future post, but for now let’s take a look at the aggregate of passengers screened across the country for the past 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/travel/TsaThroughputAnimated.gif&quot; alt=&quot;TSA Throughput - All Airports&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to figure out when COVID came in full force. We went from roughly 2M passengers being screened on a daily basis to less than 100K on April 8th, 2020. That’s just over 4K passengers screened an hour for the entire country!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-years-of-data&quot;&gt;3 Years of Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take the weekly mean of passenger throughput for the past three years, we can quickly see three interesting points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The sad state of airline travel in 2020 from April onwards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The peaks in Summer Travel are still present in 2021, 2022, although still not up to 2019 volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The traditional 1st Quarter Drop in volume is much more pronounced in 2021 and 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/travel/3YearWeeklyMean.png&quot; alt=&quot;TSA Throughput - Weekly Mean&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in the airline industry (and any service oriented industry) in 2020 was not fun. I remember volunteering to clean planes as they came into SEA. It was truly depressing to see a plane come in and only 6 people get off (usually these were airline employees). After two days of this, I realized my time would be much better spent working in the backoffice. Our hours were reduced by 10%, and that’s when I started working on this side project. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, the TSA publishes these numbers in PDF format, so in order to make the data more useful (and learn a few new skills) I created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikelor/tsathroughput&quot;&gt;TSA Throughput Project on Github&lt;/a&gt;. In future posts, I’ll talk about the architecture, individual airport trends, and how others are using the data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title type="html">AWS Adam Selipsky Keynote</title>
      <link href="/aws-keynote001" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AWS Adam Selipsky Keynote" />
      <published>2022-11-30T12:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2022-11-30T12:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/aws-keynote001</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/aws-keynote001">&lt;p&gt;From Adam’s keynote, we learned that over 50K Customers and Partners are attending re:Invent this year, and boy does it feel like it. Even though I’m spending most of my time at the Wynn, I occasionally have to make a trek over to the Venetian for a keynote, or session. That’s when the crush hits me, all of us crammed into corridors seemingly going every direction possible, except where I am going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to capture all the big announcements from this keynote in one spot, plus add a little commentary and takeaways. In another post I’m cataloging all of the announcements by Area and Product. You can checkout what this looks like at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see something wrong, or missing, hit me up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://awscommunity.social/@mikelor/&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/mlorengo/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikelor&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-intro&quot;&gt;The Intro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preamble to the announcements was somewhat predictable if not old. Sustainability Goals, Companies moving Critical Workloads (NASDAQ) to the Cloud. Re-iterated all the benefits of cloud, Velocity, Agility, Elasticity, Cost (who hasn’t heard this by now?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a great slide that sums up all of the above. The cloud allows you to “Be Prepared for Anything”. Cyber-Monday? No problem, scale up. Pandemic and no one is needing your service? Scale down, or off. Need to try something new? Get up and running quickly. Need to Pivot? Shut off that service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, onto the announcments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;announcement-1---opensearch-serverless-&quot;&gt;Announcement 1 - OpenSearch Serverless &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/preview-amazon-opensearch-serverless-run-search-and-analytics-workloads-without-managing-clusters/&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run large-scale search and analytics workloads without managing clusters. Pay only for the data that is ingested and the queries you run. 
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/aws/opensearch.png&quot; alt=&quot;Open Search Serverless&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; AWS now has a complete “Serverless” offering for its analytics services. OpenSearch is AWS’s implementation of ElasticSearch. This allows teams to get up and running quickly with minimal cost, allowing for rapid solution prototyping a variety of use cases for a number of use cases such as log analytics, application search, enterprise search, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;theme-aws-zero-etl-vision&quot;&gt;Theme AWS zero-ETL Vision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam announced AWS zero-ETL vision. Traditional data engineering requires multiple data pipelines to get data from transactional / operational databases to data warehouses (Redshift). These all need to be tested, and changed according to business needs (lots of work). The zero-ETL vision seeks to eliminate the need for this in the future. The next two announcements contribute to this vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;announcement-2---aurora-zero-etl-integration-with-redshift-&quot;&gt;Announcement 2 - Aurora zero-ETL integration with Redshift &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/amazon-aurora-zero-etl-integration-redshift/&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enable near real-time analytics and machine learning (ML) using Amazon Redshift on petabytes of transactional data from Aurora. Within seconds of transactional data being written into Aurora, the data is available in Amazon Redshift, so you don’t have to build and maintain complex data pipelines to perform extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/aws/aurorazeroetl.png&quot; alt=&quot;Aurora zero-ETL integration with Redshift&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; This is initially only supported on Aurora MySQL3 databases and is currently in Preview. IMO it eliminates E (extract) and L (load), because the way I currently understand it, transactional data is written as in Aurora (no T - Transformation) of data takes place. This does solve the problem of having users query/perform analytics on Operational Databases, by shuffling the data to Redshift, thereby reducing impact to Operational Processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;announcement-3---redshift-integration-for-apache-spark-&quot;&gt;Announcement 3 - Redshift integration for Apache Spark &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-redshift-integration-with-apache-spark/&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Builds upon an existing open-source connector project and enhances it for performance and security, helping customers gain up to 10x faster application performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/aws/sparkredshift.png&quot; alt=&quot;Redshift integration for Apache Spark&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; This was an existing capability via an Open Source Project started by Databricks and maintained by the community. Amazon worked with the community to improve the performance and security, elevating it to a fully supported feature. (so existing capability that is not officially supported).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;announcement-4---datazone-new-service-&quot;&gt;Announcement 4 - Datazone (New Service!) &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/datazone/&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Governance - a data management service that you can use to publish data and make it available to the business data catalog through your personalized web application. You can access your data more securely regardless of where it is stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/aws/datazone.png&quot; alt=&quot;Redshift integration for Apache Spark&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; Governance? People don’t want to hear about governance, but they can get behind data discovery, data quality, data access, and data security. Get with your Data Analysts, and they will tell you “just give me access”. Well, with the newly announced Amazon Datazone, you can stop talking about governance, and instead improve the usability of data for your analysts (and govern your data). AWS was lacking this capability. Azure had “Data Catalog”, which was “rebooted” into Azure Purview. This is an enterprise need. Lot’s of integration with AWS data products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;announcement-5---security-lake-&quot;&gt;Announcement 5 - Security Lake &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/preview-amazon-security-lake-a-purpose-built-customer-owned-data-lake-service/&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automatically centralizes your organization’s security data from cloud and on-premises sources into a purpose-built data lake stored in your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/aws/securitylake.png&quot; alt=&quot;Security Lake&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; Provides alternatives to SIEM (Security Incident and Event Management) products (eg Splunk), and provides integrations with existing AWS Services. Benefit of a common schema for logging (OCSF) Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework, for potential interoperability with 3rd party services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;announcement-6---more-compute-instances&quot;&gt;Announcement 6 - More Compute Instances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building upon advancements highlighted in Peter DeSantis’ keynote yesterday, multiple new EC2 compute instances were announced, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-general-purpose-compute-optimized-and-memory-optimized-amazon-ec2-instances-with-higher-packet-processing-performance/&quot;&gt;standard&lt;/a&gt; workloads, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-instance-types-in-the-works-c7gn-r7iz-and-hpc7g/&quot;&gt;network and HPC intensive&lt;/a&gt; workloads, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/aws-announces-amazon-ec2-inf2-instances-preview/&quot;&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/a&gt; workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/aws/computeinstances.png&quot; alt=&quot;Compute&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an AWS core competency, as we saw from last nights keynote, the engineering happening at the datacenter and silicon level is paying dividends at the compute level. Some of these machines are very highly specialized for large workloads (life sciences, industrial engineering, etc), not something a lot of enterprises use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;announcement-7---simspace-weaver-&quot;&gt;Announcement 7 - SimSpace Weaver &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-simspace-weaver-build-large-scale-spatial-simulations-in-the-cloud/&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new compute service to run real-time spatial simulations in the cloud and at scale. SimSpace Weaver is great at simulating crowds. This is very useful, for example, when you’re planning large events or planning to build infrastructure like a new stadium. It is also ideal for simulating smart cities, complete with vehicles, inhabitants, and other objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/aws/simspace.png&quot; alt=&quot;SimSpace Weaver&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; Highly specialized service. If you are running these types of workloads today, you will be really happy to see this, if not..ho hum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;announcement-8---connect-capabilities-&quot;&gt;Announcement 8 - Connect Capabilities &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-release-notes.html#nov22-release-notes&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create step-by-step guides for your agents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ML Driven forecasting, capacity planning, and scheduling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contact Lens Enhancements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/aws/connect.png&quot; alt=&quot;Connect&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; New features added. In the future AWS should break these BizApps out to a separate conference, especially as they continue to grow their portfolio (see SupplyChain announcement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;announcement-9---clean-rooms-new-service-&quot;&gt;Announcement 9 - Clean Rooms (New Service!) &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helps customers and their partners to more easily and securely match, analyze, and collaborate on their combined datasets–without sharing or revealing underlying data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/aws/cleanrooms.png&quot; alt=&quot;Clean Rooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; Allows data sharing while protecting data. Excited about this! 
In the past, it was a challenge to setup data pipelines and integrations just to share data. 
I always argued that we could spend that time getting more of our data centralized to a data lake, then share that data through controls. Clean Rooms solves this problem. Azure has this capability, but (Azure Data Sharing, I believe, but doesn’t look as robust as this)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;announcement-10---supply-chain-&quot;&gt;Announcement 10 - Supply Chain &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/aws-supply-chain/&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supply Chain can connect to your existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) and supply chain management systems, without requiring replatforming, upfront licensing fees, or long-term commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/aws/supplychain.png&quot; alt=&quot;Supply Chain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeway:&lt;/strong&gt; AWS moving further into Business Apps. Is this an opening shot to established ERP vendors? Not an area I am very familiar with. Is AWS going after the Oracle and SAPs of the world? Again, not fitting the profile of the majority of attendees, but a whole new area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;announcement-11---omics-&quot;&gt;Announcement 11 - Omics &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/aws-supply-chain/&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helps healthcare and life science organizations store, query, and analyze genomic, transcriptomic, and other omics data and then generate insights from that data to improve health and advance scientific discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/aws/omics.png&quot; alt=&quot;Omics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeway:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are in the Life Sciences or Healthcare industry, you may be excited. I am not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-closing&quot;&gt;In Closing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m working on centralizing this by area and product. Here’s an example of what I’ve done so far. I will publish the final list at the end of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title type="html">Hello AWS re:Invent 2022</title>
      <link href="/hello-aws-2022" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello AWS re:Invent 2022" />
      <published>2022-11-27T12:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2022-11-27T12:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/hello-aws-2022</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/hello-aws-2022">&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-did-i-just-do&quot;&gt;What did I just do?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://reinvent.awsevents.com/learn/breakout-content/&quot;&gt;AWS re:Invent&lt;/a&gt; website, there are 50 content tracks and more than &lt;strong&gt;2,000 sessions!&lt;/strong&gt; The conference itself is spread over a &lt;a href=&quot;https://reinvent.awsevents.com/campus/#map&quot;&gt;“campus”&lt;/a&gt; of 6 resorts on opposite ends Las Vegas Strip. It’s been five years since my last AWS re:Invent conference, and if there is only one takeaway, it’s this: You Need a Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-goal&quot;&gt;My Goal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a couple of years since I worked with AWS. The pace of change happens at breakneck speed in the cloud, so it’s likely that what I worked with 2 years ago, would be a faint afterimage of AWS today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prioritize-conference-tracks&quot;&gt;Prioritize Conference Tracks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphic below is my attempt to make some sense out of the myriad of sessions listed in the conference catalog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/aws/prioritizationMap.png&quot; alt=&quot;Conference Tracks Grouped and Prioritized&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve grouped them in three major areas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Platform and Infrastructure Services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Software Applications and Industry Solutions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Management, Delivery, and Best Practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main focus would be on the next level of cloud architecture, staying away from the core Infrastructure pieces but instead prioritize serverless, platform, and analytics services. A recent article &lt;a href=&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2022/11/25/ahead-reinvent-adam-selipsky-hints-aws-next-gen-cloud/&quot;&gt;Ahead of re:Invent, Adam Selipsky hints at the AWS next-gen cloud&lt;/a&gt; hints at this trend, referring to it as the move from Classic to Next-Gen cloud. It also makes a go at leveraging AWS for another buzzword “Business Transformation”. The cloud’s move beyond infrastructure, requires a new method, where more focus is put on business change and “code” and less on the infrastructure it runs on. For those that know me, this is something I strongly believe in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built the graphic above so that each Hex is colored according to priority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teal (Top Priority)&lt;/strong&gt; - Core Building Blocks of Modern Applications, Analytics, and Applied AI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green (Secondary Focus)&lt;/strong&gt; - Enterprise Concerns and Key Case Studies for Various Industries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grey (Zero to no focus)&lt;/strong&gt; - Unless there are major announcements during a keynote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prioritize-sessions&quot;&gt;Prioritize Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to drill down on the content tracks, and find those sessions that looked interesting, as well as highlight what’s new in some of the existing service. I created the following images showing the outcome of this exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/aws/reinventsessionsgroup01.png&quot; alt=&quot;Interesting Sessions Group 1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/aws/reinventsessionsgroup02.png&quot; alt=&quot;Interesting Sessions Group 2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/aws/reinventsessionsgroup03.png&quot; alt=&quot;Interesting Sessions Group 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From those sessions above, I had to limit what I could realistically absorb and prioritize even further. To that end the highlighted sessions above from this set illustrate those sessions that I will be attending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, I’ve created a PDF of the sessions that I plan to view/attend, as well as those Keynote and Leadership sessions that will be broadcast to all Internet users. You can print it out and hightlight which sessions may be of interest to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made two PDF files available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My sessions I plan on attending/viewing, and the day and times of the sessions.

      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;assets/images/aws/AWS.Reinvent.AttendingSessions.pdf&quot;&gt;AWS.reInvent.AttendingSessions.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All of the sessions that I found interesting, and may review in the future.

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <published>2014-09-01T10:18:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2014-09-01T10:18:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/a-national-park-tour-around-the-grand-canyon</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/a-national-park-tour-around-the-grand-canyon">&lt;p&gt;In August of 2014, we took a road trip to get a taste of the National Parks in and around Utah and Arizona. The purpose was to scout out where we would want to return and spend more time on a future trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flew into LAS on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alaskaair.com/en/flights-to-las-vegas?int=AS_Destinations_-prodID:Destinations-las-vegas&quot;&gt;Alaska Airlines&lt;/a&gt; flight 616, Tuesday night. Stayed at the newly remodeled Tropicana. Nice rooms and really friendly hotel staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hotfooted it out of Vegas and had lunch in Springdale, UT, just outside of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm&quot;&gt;Zion NP&lt;/a&gt;. A great place called &lt;a href=&quot;http://oscarscafe.com/&quot;&gt;Oscar’s Cafe&lt;/a&gt;. Our waitress Rachel, took care of us recommending a couple of menu items, I had the shrimp tacos, while others in our party had an Avocado Chip Burger and a Turkey Bacon Avocado wrap. Next time, I’m ordering the Avocado Chip Burger, it has Fritos on the burger!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we would be visiting a bunch of NPs this trip we bought the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovernw.org/mm5/merchant.mvc?screen=PROD&amp;amp;product_code=17260&quot;&gt;$80 annual pass&lt;/a&gt;, good for all parks for the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once inside the park we took some time to drive around the park before heading out through the tunnel on the East side. Immediately after exiting the tunnel the is a parking lot that offers access to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zionnational-park.com/zion-canyon-overlook-trail.htm&quot;&gt;canyon overlook trail&lt;/a&gt; on the opposite side of the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a fairly easy hike that rewarded us with great views of Zion’s main canyon. The only challenge was the midday sun, although were had brought plenty of water along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/travelogue/canyonoverlook.png&quot; alt=&quot;View from the top of the Canyon Overlook trail into the Zion National Park&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;View from the top of the Canyon Overlook trail into the Zion National Park&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was few hours’ drive from the exit at Zion to our accommodations for the night, and it was pretty uneventful. We managed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zionnational-park.com/bw3.htm&quot;&gt;stop for pie&lt;/a&gt; at the Thunderbird Restaurant, “Home of the Ho-made Pie”. If your hankering for some good pie, move along, don’t bother stopping here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our destination was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quailparkldge.com/&quot;&gt;Quail Park Lodge&lt;/a&gt; in Kanab, UT. Originally built in 1963 as a roadside motel, it was recently remodeled in 2011. Billed as “Retro-Cool”, the rooms were nice, clean and comfortable. There seems to be a trend in travel to bill motels (motor hotels) as lodges. The Quail Park Lodge is one of these, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g28926-i29-k2183323-What_s_the_difference_between_lodges_hotels_motels-California.html&quot;&gt;while there is no strict definition&lt;/a&gt;, I’d consider it a motel. I prefer my rooms to have interior not exterior doors, I worry about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_I_Married_an_Axe_Murderer&quot;&gt;an axe murderer&lt;/a&gt; coming in the middle of the night. I didn’t say it was logical, but there it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t linger very long after checking in because we had a dinner reservation at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grandcanyonforever.com/dining&quot;&gt;Grand Canyon Lodge&lt;/a&gt; on the North Rim at 6:15pm and it was already 5pm with a 2 hour drive ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time in this part of the country can be a bit challenging. Kanab is in the mountain time zone, Arizona doesn’t observe Daylight Savings Time, and the Grand Canyon National Park goes by Mountain Standard Time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… when we checked into our room at 5pm, with 2 hour drive ahead of us, to make a 6:15pm reservation we thought we were okay, but we weren’t 100% sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive to the North Rim proved to be the high point of or trip, literally, we reached an elevation of 8840ft. We pulled into the parking lot about 5:25pm or was it 6:25pm, our phones were no help as they showed 7:25pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was dropped off near the lodge entrance and ran to the restaurant to verify our reservation, preparing to grovel for the next available table if our time gymnastics proved out to be incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out we were 45 minutes early, YES! With time on our side, we headed out to the back verandah to watch the waning rays of the sun paint the canyon in hues of red, amber, gold and purple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/travelogue/canyonnorthrim.png&quot; alt=&quot;View from the North Rim at the Grand Canyon Lodge&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner at the lodge was good, but it was the setting that made it fantastic, it reminded me of the time we had dinner at Crater Lake Lodge last summer. [Editor’s Note: The GC and CL lodges are truly lodges in the classical sense, no motel wannabees here]. Our waiter, Scott, an Indiana native, kept us entertained with his stories of his grandfather’s horseradish growing operation, while we played stump the bartender with an order of Greyhounds. After a dessert trio consisting of creme brulée, chocolate fudge brownie, and bread pudding, it was time to head back to the QPL for a good night sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ride back was made more exciting than the ride in due to the numerous Mule deer sightings along the side of the road, often no more than 6 feet from the median. Luckily no deer in the headlights for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After checking out of our room, it was back in the car for another full day of driving. Our destination for the night was Tuba City on the Navajo/Hopi Indian Reservation. The drive would take us along the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blm.gov/az/st/en/prog/blm_special_areas/natmon/vermilion.html&quot;&gt;Vermilion Cliffs&lt;/a&gt; , with a stop at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildlifeviewingareas.com/wv-app/ParkDetail.aspx?ParkID=197&quot;&gt;Vermillion Cliffs Condor Viewing Area&lt;/a&gt;, to view the local California Condor population. Unfortunately, the best time to view the condors is early spring, so had zero sightings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/travelogue/vermillioncliffs.png&quot; alt=&quot;No Condors, but a great view of the Vermillion Cliffs&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vermilioncliffs.com/restaurant.php&quot;&gt;Lee’s Ferry Lodge&lt;/a&gt; (another motel) for lunch. The best part of this place was the fact that they had over a 100 beers on the menu. They didn’t have my first choice &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.williamsbrosbrew.com/beerboard/bottles/fraoch-heather-ale&quot;&gt;Fraoch&lt;/a&gt; in stock anymore, so I went with the suggested &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xingubeer.com/#beer&quot;&gt;Xingu Black Beer&lt;/a&gt;. While the beer was excellent, even that couldn’t save me from thinking that my other choice for lunch, Cliff Dwellers restaurant would have been better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we headed up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/glca/planyourvisit/lees-ferry.htm&quot;&gt;Lee’s Ferry Road&lt;/a&gt;, part of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, and leveraged our Annual Park Pass for admission. We stopped at Cathedral Wash, a slot canyon trail, that was semi-passable, but still interesting. Further up the road, we hiked through the historical buildings of Lee’s Ferry and dipped our toes in the calm cool waters of the Colorado River, still crystal clear at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/travelogue/leesferry.png&quot; alt=&quot;At Lee’s Ferry, the Colorado River is still calm and clear&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Lee’s Ferry, the Colorado River is still calm and clear&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, I jumped out at the balanced rocks to get a picture with these amazing geological features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/travelogue/leesferryrock.png&quot; alt=&quot;On of the amazing balanced rocks along Lee’s Ferry Road in Glen Canyon&quot; /&gt;
On of the amazing balanced rocks along Lee’s Ferry Road in Glen Canyon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately exiting the National Recreation Area, we cross the Colorado River and stop at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_Bridge&quot;&gt;Navajo Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. While the Navajo Bridge Interpretive center was closed for repairs, we were able to walk out on the bridge and get some great views of where the Colorado starts cutting into the Grand Canyon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, it’s just over an hours’ drive to Tuba City, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.experiencehopi.com/hotel.html&quot;&gt;Moenkopi Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, a fairly new hotel, with a nice pool for cooling off and washing away the dust from the day’s outings. We had dinner at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g31391-d1888293-Reviews-Hogan_Family_Restaurant-Tuba_City_Arizona.html&quot;&gt;Hogan Family restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. They served a variety of foods including some Navajo specialties such as Navajo Fry Bread and Mutton Stew. For those with appetites, I would suggest the Navajo Fried Chicken Dinner or the Ribs. For $12 you get 4 pieces of fried chicken, coleslaw, corn on the cob, beans and jalepeno poppers. Pretty amazing. The reviews on Trip Advisor are pretty harsh, but all in all not a bad place to get some food. Incidentally, this is not owned by the Hogan family, as I learned from the nearby Navajo information center, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g31391-d1888293-Reviews-Hogan_Family_Restaurant-Tuba_City_Arizona.html&quot;&gt;a Hogan&lt;/a&gt; is a sacred home for the Navajo people to practice religious ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a good night’s sleep and a hearty breakfast of Moons over My Hammy at the Denny’s adjacent to the hotel, it was off to Petrified Forest National Park. The drive would take us through some of the most desolate land in the middle of nowhere. It prompted me to post as much to my Facebook page. About 15 minutes later, my Sister (who lives in Vegas), commented on my post that they were in the vicinity, traveling to roughly the same destination. We arranged for a meetup in Holbrook, AZ at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winners-Circle-Bar-Holbrook-AZ/32761714970&quot;&gt;Winner’s Circle&lt;/a&gt; for an impromptu family reunion. Who would have thought that we would be meeting up with each other hundreds of miles away from where we live. We hugged, chatted and said our goodbyes after 30 minutes, each back to their respective road trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/pefo/index.htm&quot;&gt;Petrified Forest National Park&lt;/a&gt; was our third National Park on this trip alone, we stopped at the visitors center, and walked the Crystal Forest trail. The petrified logs were the remains of a tropical forest over 200 million years old, when the current area was located near the equator. Similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkgo_Petrified_Forest_State_Park&quot;&gt;Ginkgo Petrified Forest&lt;/a&gt; in Washington State, this area contained lots of petrified wood and fossils. The park also houses the remains of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/pefo/historyculture/puerco-pueblo.htm&quot;&gt;Puerco Pueblo &lt;/a&gt;settlement from around 1300 AD. One of the more interesting artifacts is a petroglyph that marks the occurrence of the Summer Solstice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/travelogue/petrifiedwood.png&quot; alt=&quot;That’s petrified wood boys and girls&quot; /&gt;
That’s petrified wood boys and girls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retracing our steps back through Holbrook, AZ we passed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/route66/wigwam_village_hotel6_holbrook.html&quot;&gt;Wigwam Motel&lt;/a&gt; on historic Route 66, eventually ending up at the Doubletree hotel in Flagstaff, 90 minutes later. Moons over My Hammy can only satisfy ones hunger for so long, so we headed down to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jbsfamily.com/galaxy-diner/&quot;&gt;Galaxy Diner&lt;/a&gt; for some historic Route 66 flair. This is a classic diner in every sense of the word. With so many of my favorites on the menu it was a tough choice, but I ended up ordering the Potsie Pot Roast with a Chocolate Malt, it was not a mistake. If you are ever in Flagstaff, and like the “diner scene”, make sure you stop in at the Galaxy Diner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning it was up an at’em for a drive to the Grand Canyon South Rim. We would be spending most of the day hiking along the South Rim trail. The park has a great bus system that cuts down on car congestion, this really enhances the feeling of remoteness. We hopped on the bus to be dropped of at “The Abyss” stop, and began our walk West along the rim trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/travelogue/rimtrail.png&quot; alt=&quot;Look ma, no rails to prevent you from going over the edge on the Rim trail&quot; /&gt;
Look ma, no rails to prevent you from going over the edge on the Rim trail&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get right up to the edge on the Rim trail, there are no railings to prevent you from being stupid. It was good that we started our hike in the morning, the sun was not too hot, and foot traffic along the path was nonexistent. The destination of our three mile hike was [Hermit’s Rest(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit%27s_Rest), it offered a snack bar, water refills and restrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/travelogue/hermitsrest.png&quot; alt=&quot;At the end of the line in Hermit’s Rest&quot; /&gt;
At the end of the line in Hermit’s Rest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Hermit’s Rest, we were able to jump back on a bus to take us back to the visitor center. In the afternoon, the parking was full, and we were heading back on the road to return to Vegas. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, so I’ll end the tale here. We did end up catching Alaska Airlines flight 617 back to Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, where would we go back to? Definitely the Grand Canyon and Zion (particularly in the town of Springdale), all of the other sites are considered complete.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
